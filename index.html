    <h1>Path Following Code</h1>
    <p>This page is to let other team mates of pchs robotics 4142, 3721 or other people interested in seeing how this works. <br> This work is based off of Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code document chapter 6 (or 5 for book 2). <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of Code</a> </p>
    
    <pre>
      Path is generated using spline path generation. Basic 3rd degree path gen so 2 control points on the ends of the path.
        - Planning to switch to bezier curves

      Path following is based off of code from the Nature of Code lessons.
        - predicts the future position of the robot by extending the velocity vector of the robot. 
          Using vector projection, we find the point closests to the future position and the robot follows that point.
        - Using a combo of velocity and acceleration vectors, the robot is guided towards the desired position and follows the path.
